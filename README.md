# Box Office Revenue Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project applies a **Linear Regression** model to predict box office revenue based on various features of movies such as budget, runtime, genre, and more. The dataset is preprocessed, cleaned, and used to train a regression model which outputs revenue predictions. This project is ideal for those learning regression in machine learning or exploring data science in the entertainment industry.
